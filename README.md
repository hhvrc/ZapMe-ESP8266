# ZapMe-ESP8266

ESP8266 Firmware for communicating with collars

Will soon switch from ESP8266 to ESP32-S3 with RTOS for the following reasons:
- Co-Processor can handle burst transmissions over SPI
- Enhanced debugging experience with support for breakpoints and step-trough
- Cryptographic accelerator functions for faster SDCard Reads/Writes
- Builtin RTC to keep time when MCU be eepy
- ESP8266 is very outdated
